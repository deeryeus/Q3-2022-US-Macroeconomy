# Q3-2022-US-Macroeconomy

Q3 2022 US Macroeconomy is a Power BI Project that visualizes data of the U.S. Macroeconomy as of the third quarter in 2022. The Power BI file is categorized into the following tabs:
- **Q3 2022 US Macroeconomy** - a snapshot of the economy in 2022 as of the third quarter.
- **2022 Median Income Map** - an interactive map that lists median income of 1-4 person households by state. By selecting a state, the cards below the map will list how that state ranks in terms of various costs of living. 
- **Historical Recessions** - lists all recessions between 1960 - 2022 with interactions to explore the relationship between GDP, interest rate, inflation rate, and unemployment rate for a given recession. By selecting a year on the left panel, the graphs will zoom in and focus on that recession period. 
- **Historical Wealth Distribution** - examines the wealth distribution of income class population percentiles between 1989 - 2022. The horizontal bar chart lists asset holdings by income class population percentile, while the cards on the right list it as a percentage. The pie charts on the bottom demonstrate how much each income class population percentile owns in terms of financial equity, real estate, and consumer durables. By selecting a year on the left panel, the charts will refresh to show the figures for that year.
